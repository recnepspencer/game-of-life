# Overview

<p>I attempted to migrate the project I've been working on so far to AWS. </p>

<p>I did this because I believe being dynamic in my skills and abilities will make me attractive to employers. I think even if you are a developer who works on a very specific piece of the pie, you are more useful if you know how the whole assembly line works. Even if it just makes you better at troubleshooting, I think it is worth getting a broad knowledge.  </p>

# Cloud Database

I used AWS RDS to create a database. I used MySQL as the database engine. I used the free tier, so I didn't have to pay for it. The setup was really hard. I had to set up security groups, an ec2 instance, a whole virtual machine without a gui to set up the enviornment, a domain name, and an elastic IP. It was one of the more difficult projects I've done. I don't think there was any one piece that was hard. It is more like solving a 1000 piece puzzle. It is hard to do, but not because any one piece is hard.
